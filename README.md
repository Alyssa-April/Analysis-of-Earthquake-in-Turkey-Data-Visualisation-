# Analysis-of-Earthquake-in-Turkey-Data-Visualisation-
For our Data Visualisation and Communication subject during Master's, we were asked to work on a topic of our choice as a group. We needed to come up with a static plot, interactive plot and gif animation (3 plots per person). All plots are linked into a full data storytelling presentation. We chose to do an analysis of earthquake in Turkey.
